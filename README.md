Car Parking Space Status Finder using Python and OpenCV
Created by Harsh Shishodia
Overview
This project, developed by Harsh Shishodia, is a Python-based application that utilizes OpenCV to detect and display the status of car parking spaces. By analyzing video feeds or images of parking lots, the system can determine whether individual parking spaces are occupied or vacant. This solution aims to streamline parking management, making it easier for drivers to find available spaces and for administrators to monitor parking lot usage.

Features
Real-time Detection: Continuously monitors parking spaces using live video feeds or periodically updated images.
Occupancy Status: Clearly indicates whether each parking space is occupied or vacant.
Scalability: Can be adapted to different parking lot sizes and configurations.
User-friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for both users and administrators.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Computer Vision: OpenCV
Additional Libraries: NumPy, matplotlib (for visualization)
